                            administrative privilege. It also contain a resume of all it need with all the stuffs. To
                            note, it need to install game launchers before using it, otherwise game launchers will not

                            uninstall those coming with your PC, and install it, because it increase security for your
                            PC. I also made a program to disable all services where names are not in a white list. 
                            I'm the only one who reached such high levels of optimization and security on a PC. I

                            <li>Enabling UAC to highest level is allowing to know if battle.net is launched as admin and
                                so games, and so restart battle.net until it's not running as admin.</li>

                                graphic drivers), power automate, Intel rapid storage, and redistributable frameworks
                                (the most recents and only x86).</li>
                            <li>Turn off functionnalites but let only checked frameworks 3.5 and 4.8 from programs and

                            <li>Delete C:\Windows\System32\wlanext.exe, C:\Windows\System32\ibtsiva.exe, and C:\Program
                                Files\Intel\WiFi (dllhost), and use ethernet wire.</li>
                            <li>Use wired ethernet for your gaming PC and use Wi-Fi with MAC filter for your other
                                devices.</li>
                            <li>It's better to use only Ethernet card with a RJ45 wire connected to your modem, setting
                                network public instead of private, and uninstall from programs and functionnalities
                                under control panel, the Wi-Fi framework, but let Ethernet framework.</li>
                            <li>Revert all advanced settings of network card, and change often ethernet network card MAC
                                address with always same two first numbers corresponding to label of your card
                                constructor (from configuration of ethernet network card under control panel), because
                                there's spoofing of IP of official server due to MAC address hashing table hacked from
                                network routers between your rooter and official servers, but if you using Wi-Fi and MAC
                                address filtering under your modem settings it's boring.</li>
                            <li>Set your network to public and with only Ethernet, no Wi-Fi.</li>
                            <li>Disable from task manager all the programs starting automatically at PC start.</li>
                            <li>Install your prefered launcher, downloaded from edge, for downloading and playing your
                                prefered games, i.e. battle.net.</li>
                            <li>Repair files often from your prefered launcher and set automatically close launcher when
                                game starts.</li>
                            <li>Change your PC internal IP in IPv4 properties when you can't connect into the games.
                            </li>
                            <li>Report and block every cheaters under social tab of Call of Duty, when someone is
                                suspicious in the killcams, leave the match everytimes, because it's dangerous for your
                                PC and private data, and it helps the someone to be reported by other players like you,
                                if it's a cheater he will get banned, and you will have more good matches, and being
                                less annoyed.</li>
                            <li>There's a little way to encounter less cheaters in multiplayer games, it consist to
                                report and block cheaters, each time you have any doubt, and at first, then as soon as
                                possible, when the block list is full, to empty the list, it's because cheaters can
                                change with their hacks, their display names and platforms, but not account, and if you
                                not do that, you will always fight against these little jerky noobs in every matches you
                                want to play and in a raw.</li>
                            <li>Remove cheaters you blocked after your list is full, then you can add again the new
                                cheaters, for having true gamers in your matches and not be harrassed everytime by these
                                jerks, and so devs can take actions more easy with reports of cheating to get rid of
                                cheaters in their games.</li>
                            <li>Set Windows defender tools to highest levels (accept only call of duty and mmc to access
                                folders), add C:\Windows\System32\wbem\unsecapp.exe, and
                                C:\Windows\System32\dllhost.exe, wmic, powershell
                                (C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0), conhost, ShellExperienceHost to exploit

                            <li>Lower Call of Duty graphisms to the minimum for the best fluidity, disable useless

                                no public acces to match in order no one can join you like cheaters.</li>
                            <li>Under Windows parameters, for games, from graphical option, add Call of Duty to high
                                performance used for graphic card.</li>
                            <li>When you save your files under a USB storage device, if you asked to copy without file
                                parameters, say always yes copy the file, otherwise the file will disappear, but best to
                                copy from USB storage device to your computer disk for not be annoying anymore.</li>
                            <li>Grant acces to folder of Call of Duty only for adminstrators with the following
                                powershell command.</li>
                            icacls "D:\Battlenet Games" /inheritance:r /grant Administrators:F, or if you can't, you
                            need to install the game under C: disk, or just change permissions of folder with properties
                            allowing owner administrator, or admistrators, and disable heriting, and then convert
                            permissions to explicit, and so disable permission of user(s) for modification and all
                            others things like execution or write, it's because hackers are modifying the following
                            files:</li>
                            shmem, D3D12Core.dll, game.icn, telescope_index.dat<br />
                            <li>But it's better to merge C: and D: partition drives into C: drive with PAssist, and so
                                install games under protected system files with default path, like under C:\Program
                                Files, because for Call of Duty the following commands don't run:</li>
                            powershell -command "attrib +S C:\* /s"<br />
                            powershell -command "attrib +S C:\* /d /s"<br />
                            <li>Under administrative tools, from computer manager, in the tab disk manager, you can
                                delete D: drive, if it's at right to C: drive directly you can merge it, otherwise then
                                you can use PAssist with advanced options to merge C: and D: drives.</li>
                            <li>Uninstall/install Call of Duty often or each time you see something suspicious like ping
                                of matchmaking, because when you meet cheaters, they can modify your game while you are
                                playing, and after you are like shadow banned.</li>
                            <li>Sometimes battle.net don't save parameters, so you need to undo settings and redo, by
                                saving twice.</li>
                            <li>Windows firewall blocks launch of installation and uninstallation of games with
                                Battle.net, so set default rules when you want to do it.</li>
                            <li>Use Windows firewall rules, and also configs of CoD to copy in My Documents folder under
                                your PC, optimize and secure your PC with settings and manually from infos here, restart
                                your PC, see if it change something, but before install your favorite game launcher,
                                i.e. battle.net, otherwise it won't install, but you can still install by enabling again
                                services, disabling exploit protections, installing Digicert certificate, and run
                                launcher with administrative privilege, and also use only recent redistributable
                                frameworks found on official Microsoft website, and also set your shortcuts like for
                                Ethernet card under desktop, and monitor ressources and Windows firewall advanced
                                parameters under task bar, and also do windows update, disk cleanup, install your
                                drivers, and turn off functionnalities.</li>
                            <li>For eliminate unwanted changes on your network, it’s better checking and changing hosts
                                file in windows/system32/drivers/etc as following:</li>
                            127.0.0.1 localhost<br />
                            ::1 localhost<br />
                            <li>And checking and changing protocol file in C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc as following:
                            </li>
                            tcp 6 TCP # Transmission control protocol<br />
                            udp 17 UDP # User datagram protocol<br />
                            Empty all other files in in C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc<br />
                            <li>Disable bitlocker (volume cryptography against stolen device) from confidentiality and
                                security under Windows parameters, and use Autoruns64.exe with safe mode boot option of
                                your PC (msconfig.exe to open with Run.exe from shortcut Win + R) to disable WinDefender
                                service (delete entry), Edge update, EventLog, ALG, Printer, Screen Capture, starting at
                                PC boot, it's a tool of Microsoft, disable also all other things you think it's unsecure
                                or useless with this tool, in particular you can delete all entries like for remote
                                assistances, distant access, Xbox, GameInputSvc, Internet Explorer, Sharing, OneDrive,
                                RDP, OneSync, Sync Center, ClipSVC, Acrobat, Adobe, ActiveX, Kindle, Themes Setup,
                                Windows Desktop Update, IconCodecService, NetBios, LanmanWorkstation, SMB, SNMP, P9NP,
                                RDPNP, webclient, but if you can't delete or uncheck an entry you can open it in
                                registry for changing autorisation to administrator with all privileges and delete it
                                directly from registry, and if you are not sure of the entry you just have to uncheck it
                                not delete it, do it for all users and with Microsoft entries not hidden, don't forget
                                to save your configuration and all your registry clicking on computer under left tab
                                (the file exported is around 300 000 Ko), and if you can't reboot you just have to let
                                pushed the power button several seconds and wait 10 seconds until electricity gone
                                before reboot, for all these entries make a quick search and a name search, but if you
                                encounter issue while starting your PC open cmd prompt from start option menu and type
                                regedit.exe to import all your registry, but before deleting registry entries you can
                                identify the associate files and delete it directly from disk if the associate files are
                                used only by entries to delete.</li>
                            <li>If some settings are missing, try to repair your PC with the following cmd.exe commands.
                            </li>
                            DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br />
                            sfc /scannow<br />
                            chkdsk C: /f /r<br />
                            <li>If you have explorer.exe task memory leak you can end task with task manager
                                (Ctrl+shift+esc) and execute it again with the button at top of task manager, then in
                                the tab you just have to type explorer.exe and check the box administrator privilege,
                                and then hit the button execute.</li>
                            <li>Choose a high DPI mouse above 4000, because your aiming will be accurate in center, fast
                                at edge, and you will adjust ennemies moving more easily.</li>
                            <li>Never use third party tools, and in particular from unofficial sources, it's often virus
                                or write and read in your PC like kind of virus, it's harmless, but don't trust noobs
                                saying optimization of your PC is useless, they try optimization with low asking
                                ressource games and with a high end PC, optimization is also securing your PC and with
                                time your PC is feeling better, my tutorial here is complete in terms of optimization
                                and security as far as I can.</li>
                            <li>When you refresh your PC, set country to US, set language to United Kingdom, and set
                                your right keyboard layout.</li>
                            <li>If your PIN code isn't available you can open terminal open after restarting your PC
                                letting shift pressed while clicking on restart, then in cmd type regedit, in registry
                                click on HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, click on File in the menu, then on Load File, go to
                                C:/Windows/system32/config/SOFTWARE, in the window key name, type msoftware, then in the
                                left meny in registry entries, click on msoftware/Microsoft/Windows NT/Current
                                Version/PasswordLess/Device, then under the key name PasswordLessBuildVersion, set the
                                value of 0.</li>
                            <li>Personally I use a cheap laptop PC for working with Wi-Fi, just disabling some services
                                and Appx packages, and a expensive gaming desktop PC for playing with all the
                                optimization and the security explained here, but in both cases I use the right Windows
                                firewall rules, for my laptop the simple rules and for my desktop the advanced rules,
                                complementary I use the following programs:</li>
