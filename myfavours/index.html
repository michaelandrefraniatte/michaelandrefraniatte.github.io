                        <h3 class="w3-center colored"><b>Considerations About the Program</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            The folder of the program contains a background image file for change it with another image
                            like a stared black sky. It's possible to change or remove a favour or a content, because
                            when you click on a picture, it copy in clipboard, the picture link, and like for video,
                            it's possible to open it in favorite browser. It's possible to add without any limit. It
                            need to accept Youtube RGPD once and then restart the program. I made the web version of <a href="../myfavours-web-application/">myfavours</a>. I also made the Edge extension named
                            my-favours-extension. The extension can be installed from <a target="_blank"
                                href="edge://extensions/">edge://extensions/</a>. It's made to use on top of Youtube
                            like the program (i.e. opening the extension when your web browser is on <a
                                target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>), but it don't allow to cut
                            ads unlike the program. I made a <a href="my-favours.txt" download class="dl-link"
                               >example</a> file containing my list of contents and favours. It need to
                            open the extension under same site because it use <a href="../localstorage-info">localstorage</a> for saving the gallery. I made the Edge
                            extension named localstorage-info-extension. By letting a few times the cursor on buttons,
                            it display information bubbles, explaining the use of it. This <a href="content-id.txt"
                                download class="dl-link">file</a> is explaining the way to get content id, in order to
                            add pictures in my-favours with links under Google Drive. My gallery example isn't
                            compatible with the program. For create a new gallery, it need simply to open a empty file.
                            Also, localstorage can be corrupted after updates of Microsoft or Youtube, making the
                            buttons not appearing, but it's possible to solve the issue by deleting cookies under Edge
                            parameters. By the what, it need to disable security enforcement for Youtube from padlock at
                            left of browsing bar and delete cookies not appearing as Youtube site or Google. To note,
                            with the program, you can modify with online MS Paint and upload on Google Drive your
                            pictures, then you just need to copy the link under Google Drive from the thumbnail with the
                            menu share, and then paste the link directly. To note, if the program have issue, it need to
                            delete the cache folder under same root. The program is located under bin/release folder
                            from the code source folder in the dedicated repository. You can check <a
                                href="../directory-showcase/">here</a> to find the right repository with
                            same name.
