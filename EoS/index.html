                        <p>
                            With the equations in this program, coming from Soave-Redlich-Kwong, some other very old
                            authors and me, in 2009, I modelized and then synthetized, for the first time, in a little
                            hydrothermal system, reproducing gas generation (as I was a student in a laboratory working
                            on Origin of Life, but alone to work on my PhD), in pure quantity, and at 250°C and 140
                            bars, the molecule of Origin Of Life: The Acridine Orange. It's the organic molecule the
                            most reduced, where any other can be derived easy by oxygenation. It increases Lifetime and
                            is able to generate ADN, because it can replicate. I synthetised a lot of pure molecules
                            from easy calculation with this program. It found statistic volume of atmosphere and ocean
                            like on Earth. It prooves that ice on Mars have something under totally different than ice
                            and in big quantities like an atmosphere. I applied perfectly calculations, and from
                            original equations, I made only 2 changes, empirically and theorically prooven from very old
                            authors and my works with a new mathematical hypothesis I found. I was able to resolve
                            derivation of all polynomial equations, resolve all polynomial equations with a hand pen,
                            all differential equations better than with CNP functions which is a wrong method, all
                            eletrochemical potentials, define all diffusion coefficients of materials from diffusion
                            profil, find the properties of 2 unknown constituents, all PVTX data, PT traject of all
                            fluid inclusions, solubilities of all constituents in all fluids, proove the equality of
                            pressures from each side of a membrane, proove that any molecule pure in a closed system are
                            stabilized at any temperature and any pressure, resolve all chemical reactions, synthetise
                            easy any molecule and find all properties of molecules. In 2009, my contribution was to make
                            working Equation of State method for all PVTX data and chemical reactions, with experimental
                            proofs, and in all environements without any fake idea, after 50 years of copy/paste wrong
                            articles without any interest, if I did not do that. Even this said, actually nobody made
                            better in anything concenring EoS, but it's not recognized in any manner by scientific
                            community. The data for PVT and PVTX, on NIST, in scientific articles on pure gases, and on
                            mixtures, often mixed for constituents in same mixture are either a volume of gas per mole
                            of gas, or a volume of liquid and gas per mole of gas, or a volume of liquid and gas per
                            mole of liquid and gas. It need to search proofs among the experimental protocoles, but it
                            can be found easy with my modelization where I applied perfectly EoS and changed only 2
                            equations from original of Soave-Redlich-Kwong. It's very accurate and established chemical
                            reaction data for stabilize and synthetize any molecule. If I could publish, I would make an
                            article: An Improved Redlich-Kwong-Soave Equation of State for Defining and Correlating All
                            PVT-PVTX Data. I would decline it with other EoS types, like with Peng-Robinson EoS. I would
                            also make another article on modelization of any molecule synthesis at high temperature and
                            high pressure, with experimental examples. I would also make an article on why you can't
                            measure fugacity coefficients, and why it's only possible by studying reactions. And other
                            articles on Earth, and Mars with their atmospheres and soils in terms of constituent volumes
                            and quantities from sonde measures and my model. But also one article on two unknown
                            constituents I can proove the existence. I've published in 2008 an article on the stability
                            of Adenine at 300°C and normally 500 bar. In 2009, after calculations, I've synthetized
                            Acridine Orange at 250°C and normally 140 bar. It's the same experiment, only temperature
                            changed and it's water instead of water and aqueous Adenine. The rocks of geological Archean
                            times are layers of oxidized iron (magnetite) and quartz, which prooving the Origin of Life
                            in conjunction with my experiment. I'm interested to publish my works in articles. I also
                            have lot of ideas for publish other works around my modelization and around other things I
                            found. It's normal the author I am on it, I can publish myself my works on it. It's normal I
                            can submit all my discoveries to the eyes of the scientific community. I've had fun with
                            several CSV files coming with the program. I've had fun to modelize and synthetize
                            everything, had fun to discover responses to the Unviversal Universe, just thinking that in
                            a closed system (which is open on itselve), gas molecules and liquid molecules are in same
                            number for a given constituent, so the system itselve is half gas and half liquid, and gas
                            can be more dense than liquid. The program is illustrating with the following 4 pictures,
                            where Acridine Orange synthesis is taken in example. Let's see...

                        <p>
                            I've been inspired by <a href="../solar-system-showcase">this</a> page I found on <a target="_blank" class="dl-link"
                                href="https://codepen.io">codepen.io</a>. Scientific community don't know to make
                            Science, they just describe simple situations and tweak simple curves from experimental
                            measures. They think of gas and liquid phasis above and under liquid-vapor curve, but it's
                            like electrochemical potentials, the curve is calculated from the equilibrium, i.e. when
                            it's equal. They don't believe in spontaneous generation of molecules and don't believe
                            chemical reaction can be equilibrate automatically. They don't believe the number of
                            constituents intervene in the only true model of EoS I did and applied. They believe to
                            equality of chemical potentials from each edge of a membrane. Hydrogen diffusion through a
                            membrane for 10 bars, mixing with argon at 500 bars, make increase the total pressure to 513
                            bars because for them hydrogen have a fugacity coefficient of 1.3. But everyone can
                            understand that argon has less space making argon to be at 503 bars. From each edge of a
                            membrane it's the equality of pressures, not of fugacities as they thinking. If it was the
                            equality of fugacities why hydrogen alone in the system would not be at 13 bars? Very old
                            authors are all dead, and scientific community think only new and all new articles are true,
                            old are wrong, and also think since the new century that they don't have to make any more
                            fundamental researches, like if everything were well established, even if not working like
                            EoS, saying if you have the pressure, you don't have the volume and vice versa, instead of
                            assuming their fails. They making intervene strange interaction coefficients which need
                            experimental measures for each fluid. They even trying to make group contribution on it,
                            like in thermodynamic for molecules. But they trying just to have equilibrium constant of
                            reactions, without knowing it, but I can say it's far from what I found to do. What I made
                            and found are theorically, experimentally, and empirically prooven, and modelize the entire
                            matter in the Universe. I made the web version of <a href="../EoSResol-Web-Application/">EoSResol</a>. <a href="../EoSArticle-Book/">This</a> is my book about the equations, <a
                                href="../EoSPrograming-Book/">this</a> is my book about the WinForms, <a
                                href="../EoSExcel-Book/">this</a> is my book about the
                            XLS, <a href="EoSResolXLS.xls" download class="dl-link">this</a> is my XLS file with macros,
                            and I made example <a href="EoSResolCSV.zip" download class="dl-link">CSV files</a> 
                            to open with the web version after having extracted it from the compressed zip folder. And I also made the Windows Store
                            program that was published but fired. I'm not lying in any manner. At the end, Scientific
                            community regrets it's my discoveries, but why? They did nothing good with EoS, but are
                            still spending billions per article for inventing weird interactions, and what about for
                            Origin of Life? I such want growing my model, but I'm fired from every jobs I apply.
                            Scientific community create models for each gas mixture but with sawtooth curve. It's full
                            of so-called big searchers who copy the equations from other articles and come up with
                            figures out of nowhere. I'm the only one who find a Universal model for every fluids, while
                            they talking of gases. They laughed on me it was not Acridine Orange in my experiment at
                            250°C and normally 140 bars, but they made so much time to allow me to make analysis, after
                            to do on purpose broke a very expensive machine that would allow me to do it, that it turned
                            into residual food of bacteria, but they were happy to announce me it was not the expected
                            Acridine Orange, not thinking it was the residual food. They said I will be unable to
                            synthetize it again, because they said I made an error, and it would be impossible for me to
                            find which error. They fired me, and printed on papers all my researches the day I was
                            leaving definitively the laboratory. I'm sure they tried to make my experiment, but were
                            unable to find the Acridine Orange, because even if I alerted to not use Nitric Acid to
                            clean the sealing Gold socket, they probably did it as always, due to Nitric Acid is royal
                            water disolving Gold, while they were questionning themselves why their Gold stock remelted
                            was stung. To note, it need to set dot instead of comma for number floating as decimal
                            separator in regional options, under control panel. To note also, for finding PT traject of
                            fluid inclusion, it needs to define the molar volume at the homogeneisation temperature for
                            which the pressure avoid the extrem growth of molar volume at 1 bar above. However, this
                            molar volume doesn't reflect exactly the one when fluid inclusion was trapped. The true PT
                            traject is when the matrix melting to free the fluid inclusion, and the true traject of the
                            rock or the mineral is above the curve defines by this PT traject to trap the fluid
                            inclusion by colding. It need to have critical parameters of the components of the mixture
                            that made the rock or the mineral, nothing about liquidus/solidus from geometry definitions,
                            more about the density of the mineral or the rock. There are researchers who are so lame
                            that they are able to see nothing under their eyes, like making a project that is doomed to
                            failure in advance, for example, the project on radioactive wastes in France, is not viable
                            because the argilite of the Bure site has traces of fluid intrusions on a geological scale
                            and this rock is completely fractured, as proof an area is forbidden to the public where
                            there was a huge collapse, someone even died, because everything fell on him, just to see
                            the precautions that the workers took to be able to dig the rock, they put concrete back
                            every centimeter dug to be able to dig back, never seen in any sub-ground career, in
                            addition, the only impenetrable layer above this rock is a marl, but its thickness is only
                            10 meters, if there were sedimentation stops then its thickness can be 0 meter in some
                            places, because a geological layer always has variations in thickness, in addition, there
                            has been no modelling on pressures and temperatures, and the fate of barrels. There have
                            just been small experiments at the microscopic level in argilite only, nothing at the
                            macroscopic level. And also, there are researchers so lame, that they clean their
                            experiments with Nitric Acid, but normally experiments must be a closed system, and Nitric
                            Acid is royal water disoving Gold, and they asking themeselves why their Gold stock is
                            pigmented. And also, they don't know the trick to go forward to logarithm when they have
                            exponential. Now researchers believe they can keep some secrets outside their publishing
                            because they said it's against thieves, so their publishing have none of interest anymore
                            because nobody can check and reproduce, there aren't anymore any science, and they open the
                            door to fake publishing, I can't understand how it have been reviewed and published while
                            some technics are keep secrets, it's not normal to proceed like this while publishing in
                            scientific papers, it's nothing of sciences. I've seen twice without running about, once a
                            long time ago when I was studying as a Doctor, and twice recently from a youtube video,
                            researchers publishing works they made with their students as Doctors, but without making
                            appearing the names of their students, there's also my case where researchers made nothing
                            but stolen everything, even without any level, but they were drag I think, and I thanks for
                            it, yet in my case since I had 10 years old, firstly by TV and ads, it was not simple. So a
                            researcher can now grant oneself the rights to omit references and to not internationalize
                            his classifications. They thinking impossible to equilibrate reactions by a program, the
                            spontaneous generation of molecules, to predict earthquakes, but they believing to be able
                            to measure fugacities without studying reactions, to confine Uranium in broken rocks
                            without any real impervious layer, and to make real experiments in gold seals using Nitric
                            Acid for cleaning just before put in an oven. The program is located under bin/release
                            folder from the code source folder in the dedicated repository. You can check <a
