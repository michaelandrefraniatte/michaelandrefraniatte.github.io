                            It correspond to a program, receiving data from physical programmable circuit board, like
                            Arduino or Teensy, where are connected sensors as inputs, for simulating outputs as Virtual

                            as pro player. It's possible to associate any controller or create one with motion sensors,
                            like accelerometer and magnetometer (to replace IR cam and sensor bar), in order to task as

                        <p>
                            The program is made for being more competitive than usual, but it ask a lot of experiences,
                            and to want aiming or driving like in virtual reality games. The simple way is to connect
                            sensors to Arduino or Teensy, and receive data in a program to simulate a virtual Xbox
                            controller or virtual keyboard and mouse or interception or DS4 controller or virtual
                            joystick. Then with a 3D printer, build an armor for a controller or two armors for a
                            splitted controller. It's possible to print armors in a multimedia center or a public
                            workshop with low cost. I have programed with Teensy, Arduino, IR cam, WebCam, Microphone,
                            CronusMax, Cronus X-Aim, GIMX, GlovePie, Chiaki, PS Remote Play, Devreorder, Interception,
                            Scp, ViGEm, vJoy, AirMouse, Keyboard, Mouse, Wiimote, Joycon, Joycon Charging Grip, Pro
                            controller, DualShock4, Dualsense, Xbox controller, PPJoy controller, Six Axis controller...
                            For all games, on Linux, Windows, Playstation, and Xbox. I have a lot of knowledges in
                            controllers and motion controls, and so I can say that console isn't adapted to play games
                            with motion controllers, because less than 10% of console games are playable with. PC is the
                            ultimate platform to play games with motion controllers and to create one, because more than
                            90% of PC games are playable with. I prefer emulate inputs with sensors the controller I
                            built, and simulate outputs with a program the Human Interface Device (HID) to play all
                            games on PC. I choose this method because with microcontrollers or on consoles you can't
                            have any accuracy. Also you prevent the built controller to be recognized and connected by
                            games and launchers on PC like it's doing actually with console controllers and it's very
                            weird. It have broke all the works I did with several decades on it. Another important
                            thing, about Cronus and Titan adapters, is that console constructors are hating it to play
                            on their consoles, and so potentially you will be forwarded on hacked lobbies from
                            matchmaking, and it's weird controls how the adapters are running but also how games are
                            configured on consoles, and finally comparing consoles to PC, you can have better settings
                            in terms of optimization and security with a PC, like I did. There are nice tutorials, <a

                                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qUvamu9DLA">here</a> on Six Axis controllers to
                            start easy playing with motion controls without annoying setting it up. You can find <a
                                target="_blank" href="https://en.flydigi.com/index/down">here</a> the
                            driver for Flydigi controllers. You can use August LP310 Remote Airmouse, used normaly for
                            Power Point presentation, but for Top Down Shooters or First Person Shooters, combined with
                            a controller. The native support of controllers in PC games, not native controllers known as
                            keyboard/mouse and Xbox controller, is a very bad idea, because it result in low
                            optimization of games and low or bugged or not running handle of controllers like with
                            DirectInput controllers or Dualsense, also it's not in favor of some developers who want
                            practice on controller support, and it's a time consumer for game developers. I did better
                            controller support than native controller support in games of game developers, and with
                            better and infinite customizations. My goal for building a custom controller in terms of
                            polling rates is to reach a number under 14 milliseconds, it's largely doable, and it's
                            sufficient, because a game is caped generally at 30-60 FPS, a big screen have a latency of
                            around 10 milliseconds, and the ping of a server is around 20 milliseconds, so there's no
                            need to go far under and I already checked with a time watcher the polling rates, no need to
                            eat one CPU for nothing, but just lagging. But it stay always better to simulate a Keyboad/Mouse, because of the deadzone
                            unsignifiant, contrary to the deadzone of a controller, and sometimes very badly handle at
                            the output of the deadzone too sensitive, but also the lowest sensitivity when aiming down
                            sight not competitive at all, and almost impossible to have a good aim by tricking the
                            sensitivities, or even the maximum sensitivity toggle after only a certain amont of timing
                            at maximum path of the stick. I made the showcase <a href="../AimController-Showcase/">here</a>. 
                            The program is located under bin/release folder from the code source folder in the dedicated repository. 
                            You can check <a href="../directory-showcase/">here</a> to find the right repository with same name.
