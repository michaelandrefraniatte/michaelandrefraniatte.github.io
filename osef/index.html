                            I made a prototype framework for coding page to page websites, in order to demonstrate that
                            native codes are more easy to use, than known frameworks not allowing communication between
                            front-end and back-end in both ways. Let's see...

                        <p>
                            It's more and more difficult to find native codes in web development, because it's more and
                            more packaged with more and more frameworks. Everybody want to create their own framework,
                            but they forgive security and optimization, but also developer and user learning. Often it's
                            just a copy/paste, with bugs and obscelete codes, without taking count of big groups
                            implemented since the start with amazing tools. I also made a cookie manager with a
                            particular workout I invented to discharge third party scripts, as a Drupal module to adapt
                            for osef. I learned a lot always searching the best while coding, like a heavy client
                            program is like a server, but contrary a web application running on a server must always be
                            coded in oriented object because only one instance of the program is running on a server,
                            you must instantiate objects for each functionnalites with everytimes classes, otherwise any
                            same data is coalescent with other for any user, it's coalescent when variables are declared
                            as static in class for example, even if you instantiate it as an object. Almost all programs
                            in the world are coded with foots, even more if it's made by a lot of people, it embed
                            libraries with big vulnerabilities and hacks, it's made with design patterns for just use
                            design patterns with none of knowledge, the databases are full of tables full of columns,
                            it's full of backends, and a frontend lagging as hell, for just 3 functionnalities with tons
                            of useless lines, unbelievable and inapprehensible, sometimes with no commentaries,
                            sometimes with functions containing 6000 lines of code, sometimes with projects linked to
                            other projects, but in same folder for different solutions, and when you reference it, it's
                            the hell, and everywhere in the world, it's the same bad guys believing to know coding and
                            the effect of codes, but nothing in fact, and they all winning lot of money, some people
                            struggle for weeks and weeks on the same problem, while when it takes 2 seconds of lucidity,
                            and you can't touch their codes to clean a little, they are too lazzy to clean themselves
                            their codes, thinking it's all good, even if 90% of lines are useless. You can check <a

                        <ul>
                            <li>Most of employers and employed are believing there are not so much talents, and all
                                talents are already employed.</li>
                            <li>It's just employed that don't know coding in fact, and so it's too hard for a true
                                talent to scum the same and in their codes, so it's scum.</li>
                            <li>Employed are so noobs that they don't want you return their codes for having good
                                coding, because they are so scarry and unable to review, and do different (with the true
                                feelings).</li>
                            <li>Employed are training themselves with design patterns thinking it's cool and usefull
                                because they don't know to make simple, and they believe to learn for themselves like
                                that.</li>
                            <li>When they doing their own frameworks, and methods, it's a rampage.</li>
                            <li>They are just good at stealing copyrighted contents and earning money with, but without
                                found the creators asking founds clearly, and without making any advance, quid helping
                                the creators.</li>
                            <li>By making nothing and bad, workers are able to deliver stuffs to employers for
                                customers, and they not found what they use from indies even if indies are asking
                                founds.</li>
                            <li>They making believe to have worked hard and sometimes alone and first on a subject, but
                                they just have stolen indies.</li>
                            <li>They believe everything trigger circular reference error, they don't believe you can
                                add triangular reference. They don't know circular reference is just between two
                                projects, but it's so badly designed that you are seek to do it.</li>
                            <li>There are all kinds of saboters and sabotage, you lose your works like never before,
                                they are too lazy to revert one file commit to help you a little, they revert all your
                                commit.
                            </li>
                            <li>The codes are over written, 10 times too much codes, 10 times too much pages, even more
                                sometimes, for nothing more than flooded, no commentaries, no documentations, no
                                contacts with the clients to see clearer, it's a joke.
                            </li>
                            <li>When you are experimented and know coding well a program, there are one or two little
                                features you never coded that appear, but saying that to others in a job will make you
                                appear as a crazy guy, they will say you don't know what you doing, you are bad at
                                coding, and everybody will joke at your face, but in fact, who criticize you is badly
                                unexperimented.
                            </li>
                            <li>When you want to push a commit for saving your works of the day, not a realease, you can't,
                                because they want it all tested and completly working, and sometimes they don't want you repair
                                an error, and push it in release... It's just because they all don't know to work together.
                            </li>
                            <li>Only few experimented developers can know what mean: only use it if you need it.
