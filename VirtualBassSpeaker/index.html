                            This program is an equalizer and amplifier of sound able to forward sound simultaneously on
                            several sound peripherals. The main goal was to predict where come from ennemies easier, by
                            earing footsteps amplified as a footsteps amplifier for FPS games. Let's see...

                        <p>
                            It's for use as a bass speaker, enabling to ear sound on multiple speakers. It's made if you
                            have a laptop PC and external speakers as default peripheral for listen music. The internal
                            speakers of your laptop PC are used as bass speaker. Both external and internal speakers
                            must be enable, and level of earing well adapted. If you encounter issue while using the
                            program, you can delete tempsave file under same folder of the program. If you set default
                            speakers and level of earing to 0, the internal speakers of your laptop PC, the program task
                            as an equalizer. By the what, you can have several Bluetooth speakers connected to your
                            laptop PC, and then forward like this the sound by opening several times the program and
                            choosing which speakers to control the sound out, in order to listen the sound
                            simultaneously on several speakers, without the need of other program or method that would
                            be invasive. If you have external speakers to ear virtual sound and a sound barre to
                            virtualize bass, it's a must have. To note, the changes in equalizer settings take effect
                            when you click on the start button, not in real time. It's a success after several attempts
                            like with ModernEqualizer, or SoundBooster, or UniversalEqualizer. The program is located under
                            bin/release folder from the code source folder in the dedicated repository. You can check <a
