                            The program is a simple tool for get ride of cheaters eveywhere and everytime. It stands on
                            one side server where cheaters can cheat freely, and on one side where players can play
                            freely. All multiplayer games have hacked servers, and official servers. But there are
                            official servers worst than hacked servers. It consist of setup a firewall for the game play
                            that deserve to be play, and a automatic research which add firewall rules when you play.
                            With it, you will find what is the game play, and so enjoy it fully, playing on official
                            servers. Let's see...

                        <p>
                            It needs you tune the firewall used, when you want to play other games. But with the setup
                            button all the firewall rules for the game are automatically created. There isn't any
                            conflict with rules for all your other games. You just need to delete rules added with the
                            automatic search which create specific rules. When you want to play the game play, hit the
                            start button, becoming the stop button. In resume, it create firewall rules. It need to set
                            IPv4 properties manually, and having a local administrator account session for your PC. You
                            can open task manager (ctrl + shift + esc) for localize Edge, Fortnite, or Call of Duty. If
                            you want more workaround about Call of Duty, check my <a href="../GuideFirewall/">guide</a>
                            for it. I also tried a long time ago to make a complete program named NewB. The cheaters are
                            legion in video games. They are mentally deficient and a mental desease, they are
                            psychopaths. They can only enjoy a game cheating for destroy players. They are more than 100
                            000 times stronger than any good player. They represent 80% of the Steam communit, they spam
                            the forum when they are shadow banned or banned definitively, and get unbanned easily, lying
                            they never cheated of their lifes. They forward any good player in their hacked lobbies each
                            time any good player want to play. They got 44+ cheats and use it at same time. They making
                            frag movies all over Youtube, and have a lot of subscribers. Good player should retire
                            themselves from social networks and complain directly to developers. The cheaters have not
                            their places in video games, otherwise it falling totally. Even if now aimbot is humanized,
                            it still look like not human, like trigger aiming without knowing there's an enemy at left
                            or right, like aim down sight toggle 100 milliseconds. Those who defend cheaters are
                            cheaters too, and it's often, because they are legion. They insult any good player
                            complaining in Steam forums. It's the worst community ever, they learn nothing and have none
                            of knowledge. They are just in the forums to insult any good player. They have friends, but
                            it's friends like them. They are everywhere in the world in any place, it's the true issue.
                            They like to destroy anyone they don't like. The world is made like that. Call of Duty, like
                            all popular competitive multiplayer games, give you want vomit everywhere everytime, such
                            there are only tryhards and cheaters, it's a buisness to sale hacks and cheats, and
                            developers of these games are not the best policemans, removing all criminals before they
                            commit crimes, even if they can, they are more criminals pushing players in the hands of
                            hackers and cheaters, and also players don't see now, after hackers humanized their cheats,
                            who is cheating to report he or she, only old players can recognize that it's impossible to
                            aim down sight only 50 ms, and can see after becoming a cat, they are only a mouse now,
                            cheaters running after them like they are purchased with their smell, and killed with half
                            of a bullet of a SMG by only cheaters everywhere, and everytime of course, welcome in Call
                            of Duty mad world, this ship of fools well real, cheaters are so noobs that they need to
                            profit a little, and nobody can do without a double income if they can do, a lot of people
                            have no passion of course, maybe only porn like Call of Duty. The only resolution to not
                            always fight against cheaters invading every games, every matches, everytimes, is to not
                            play multiplayer matches, because hackers are strongest, there's nothing to do against these
                            anti-players, I tried 10 years finding everything to do, but the only things to benefit is
                            the optimization of a PC for better performance and durability explained a bit everywhere
                            here, use only Steam for playing solo games and grind some achievements and friends, use
                            firewallsteam.wfw to keep your PC a little safe moreover, and don't be concerned by security
                            settings I'm talking about above, because it's a little harder and annoying like cheaters in
                            multiplayer games, it's better to fight some bosses than cheaters I think, you will enjoy so
                            much more, or not spending lot of money and time for raging even more. Anti-cheat of Call of
                            Duty, known under the name of Ricochet (or more Rick Hochet), use mitigations as devs call
                            it, for make appearing a clone of player, in order aimbot target the clone, not the player,
                            or for make disappearing a player, I think devs give another tool to hackers of cheats and
                            server renters, in order to annoy more fair players, in fact devs are saying it detect
                            cheaters and ban them, but not at all, it give also another tools to hackers to ban good
                            players and to make more humanized cheats, the number of cheaters is always increasing like
                            the number of cheats, comparing to other games, the franchise is more and more ridiculous,
                            like buying and playing it, devs even not tried to enable natively ASLR, in order to disable
                            the ability to cheat. Call of Duty games destroy your PC like node isolation disabling,
                            Windows update broken, IP leak, hacking exploit, hackers remote access, ..., because of
                            hacked lobbies as seen with perfmon.exe (ressource monitor under the tab network where IP of
                            servers connected are such stranges). There are cheats with read/write process memory easy
                            to detect with reverse engineering but not banned by CoD devs, then they developped built in
                            cheats in game exe for their organized competition like wallhack, but now they deliver their
                            cheats built in games with more and more cheats and bugged, meanwhile they developping
                            remote PC cheats with memory execution with string reflection, and now they integrating AI
                            (Artificial Intelligence) for developping cheats lonely while ASLR is enable, and for all
                            mutiplayer games, cheats can run in expansion packages with obfuscation, while the program
                            integrating it is heavy, it's impossible to incoroprate analysis so much there are data to
                            analyse and even anti-cheats integrating player statistics, it stay too much data, and very
                            confusing. Why cheaters can be invisible while you are sure to aim and fire them, they kill
                            you, and in the killcam, they are where you was aiming... Ricochet mitigation? But it's not
                            me the cheater... Also your aim when you fire the cheater is like you are fired but the
                            cheater fire only after... I've also killed a cheater, it was display his name, but he
                            continued alive and killed me... A god mode don't display the kill... All of These are new,
                            and it can only come with a cheat binary game built by devs. I think Call of Duty devs are
                            creating cheats for all other multiplayer games that they don't own, using the ways I
                            exposed just above, and with all their knowledges of mitigations while doing Ricochet where
                            kernel is their hacker new arms, and their games are a sandbox, beware of them, they almost
                            created the world war III with sharpness of all the atrocities coming with.
                            Gameservers/Clanservers are hackers renting servers to console cheaters, they exploited
                            hacks on consoles to create servers in games on consoles a long time ago, don't trust them.
                            For some reasons, like hackers and haters are targeting you, using a VPN is better than
                            using Windows firewall, but some settings are required, let the services running like SSDP
                            service, Telephonic service, and Telephony, NetBios service, set to default properties of
                            IPv4 from network card, and all services installed of network card, and set to default
                            Windows and modem firewall. You can compare Windows integrated VPN using vpnbook p2p servers
                            (not servers optimized for the web) with WTFast, ExitLag, and mudfish. For using VPN on
                            consoles, you can share connection from a PC using a VPN, wired with a RJ-45 cable. The
                            program is located under bin/release folder from the code source folder in the dedicated
                            repository. You can check <a href="../directory-showcase/">here</a> to find the right repository with same name.
