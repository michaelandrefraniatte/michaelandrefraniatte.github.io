                            The guide is for MW2 (2022) on Battle.net, but in general it can be applied for all Call of
                            Duty and on Steam, then it need to look up IP of connection with ressource monitor
                            (perfmon.exe), for entering the game with authentication. Fortunatly, It don't need to
                            search about game server IP. IP of servers are spoofed by hackers to open hacked lobbies
                            where cheaters banned can still invade the game. They can cheat on these unofficial servers,
                            and you, legit players, are falling against them, in every matches. Using Windows firewall
                            of your PC and opening a NAT/PAT rule on your modem/router, can solve the problem, with the
                            right rules. Let's see...

                            For using Windows firewall with right rules, you need to set manually your network
                            configuration. Open cmd.exe and enter ipconfig, to see your DNS IP, and internal IP of your
                            PC. Open control panel and then network and share center. Under details, for properties of
                            your network card, you can set IPv4 properties allowing to set a static IP corresponding the
                            the internal IP of your computer, and set the DNS local IP of your modem/router. The sub
                            network mask is auto completed. You can also add a DNS server, but in case you don't want,
                            you can set the DNS local IP of your modem/router instead.

                            By connecting to your modem, you can create a NAT/PAT rule for port 3074 in UDP for your PC.
                            It allow inbound traffic, but block the traversal edge which is used by hackers to spoof IP

                            and videos on internet, dedicated to your modem/router.

                                Blocking Unofficial Servers</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            Set Windows firewall properties to blocking if no rules for inbound and outbound traffic. If
                            your connection is set to private or public, the properties tab where to set it shall
                            corresponding to the network type of your connection. A public network is more secure than a
                            private network because the share capabilities are disable for a public network. The inbound
                            traffic allowed with NAT/PAT rules do the trick for playing on official servers because the
                            outbound traffic allowed with Windows firewall must block server connection. For other games
                            than Call of Duty, it need to create rules for these games, otherwise you can save and
                            restore to default Windows firewall, like for updating your PC. It's from upper right
                            corner, to restore default rules, and open/save a Windows firewall configuration. There are
                            2 important tabs where to add rules for services, game launchers, and games. There's a tab
                            for outbound traffic and a tab for inbound traffic. The tabs can be accessed from upper left
                            corner. The very first tab, when you open Windows firewall, is the tab corresponding to
                            Windows firewall properties with a link to access configurations, where you will set the
                            properties for inbound and outbound traffic (blocking if no rules) for your network type
                            (private or public). It's settings you have to set in combo boxes. The next step is to
                            create rules for services, game launchers and games. It's easy to get the name and the path,
                            by opening task manager with the shortcut ctrl + shift + esc on your keyboard. Click right
                            on a task to open the control menu where you can open the folder to copy path, and then when
                            you specify a program in a rule, you can paste the path in address bar and get the
                            corresponding program to allow traffic. I advice to create a shortcut icon on task bar for
                            Windows firewall with advanced rules, and also one for the ressource monitor, perfmon. It's
                            possible Windows firewall isn't enable because you have a firewall from a anti-virus.
                            Managing rules with firewall from a anti-virus, is possible. But if you uninstall
                            anti-virus, Windows firewall will be enable. Don't worry, Windows have also his own
                            anti-virus, and it will be enable also.

                        <p>
                            For this step, the most important, you need to remove all rules. You can use shift and left
                            click for select all rules from the first to the last, and then click right on it to delete
                            by opening the control menu. It need to create several rules. To create a rule, click right
                            to open control menu, and then click add a new rule. A tab to create a rule is appearing.
                            Check the box personnalized rule, and click next. After doing it one time, I prefer
                            copy/paste the rule, for create another and configure it manually. The first rule to create
                            is for the service client DNS, to choose under the tab programs and services. All services
                            and programs shall be enable again if you choose a program name and path. Configuration for
                            service client DNS: - Protocole > UDP, local ports: 49152-65535, distant port: 53. - Local
                            IP > your PC internal IP, distant IP > your DNS server IP (here my modem/router IP because I
                            didn't set a server DNS). You need to create allowing rules for Battle.net, Battle.net Agent
                            (changing of path when Battle.net is updated), if you using Battle.net (all protocoles).
                            Same rules for Steam, Steam Web Helper, and Steam client service (local ports > 49152-65535,
                            distant ports > 80, 443, 27000-27050 in TCP), if using Steam. Configuration for the game

                            185.34.104.0-185.34.108.255, 95.179.128/17. This last scale of IP is corresponding to IP of
                            matchmaking search. It can be different from game to game, and outside europe. If the game
                            is updated, it need to restore to default Window firewall, and close the game, then open the
                            configuration, and go to the game. It lack IP but the majority of time, it's enough and more
                            secure so. The connection to official servers for playing a match is with the next step. It
                            need rules in UDP of course.

                                Inbound Traffic</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            This step is also the most important, it's the core of the trick to play on official
                            servers. It also need to remove all rules. It need to create 3 rules for the game. It's
                            almost the same 3 rules for the game. The first is a rule allowing, the second is a rule
                            blocking and the third is a rule allowing if secure with something to except. All 3 rules
                            have these configurations: - Protocole > UDP, local ports > 3074 (rule blocking with
                            traversal edge instead of 3074), distant ports > 1024-49151. - Local IP > your PC internal
                            IP, distant IP > 0.0.0.1-223.255.255.255. The rule allowing if secure with distant computer
                            to except the rule: - Do not take account of group creator. - Add a policy, click on
                            advanced, click on search, click on group creator. - Add group creator to distant computer
                            to except the rule. You can copy/paste the allowing rule after creating it, and change to
                            blocking (with local ports assignate to traversal edge), and allowing if secure, and for
                            this one, except the rule for group creator from distant computer tab.

                        <p>
                            By opening ressource monitor, perfmon.exe, you can see IP of connection. By restoring
                            default Windows firewall rules, and restarting the game, you can see all IP, under the tab
                            network. Check the game in first tab, the tab under is for UDP IP, and under for TCP IP. If
                            you have any problem, you can save and restore rules under Windows firewall tab, at top and
                            right corner. If you don't find IP of connection using perfmon, it's possible to test IP
                            with scales, defining IP scale more and more fine, until find the good IP scale. Also by
                            checking on bgpview.io, you can have the sub network mask precisely.

                            After all done, you are a pro for setting your PC. Windows firewall is a good tool to start
                            for optimize your PC. It don't allow your PC to be attacked easily, with lot of connection
                            always invading your PC. It's a way to start optimizing your PC. There's lot of tutorials on
                            other way very interesting and important over internet. I'm also able to disable services,
                            but without knowing exactly which services to disable, it's risky. But using other tutorials
                            and this one I made for you, it's far from risky. If you set everything, and you are Open
                            NAT in MW2, your are all good.
