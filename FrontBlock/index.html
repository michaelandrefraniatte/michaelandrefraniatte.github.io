                        <p>
                            The game I imagined is a table game, where players must have more positions to win. Each
                            player goes by 2 positions from left to right for first player, and right to left for the
                            second player... Each position are consecutive or not, but consecutive after each turn,
                            advancing position by position. When a player attacks to front the other player(s), he wins
                            two positions to play as follow. The winner of victory is the player who has more positions.
                            Let's see...

                        <p>
                            The color can be undo, but it counts as one position done. Prefer that, the player who undo
                            a color corresponds to the player who has this color, when it's his turn so. No, it's a
                            joke, the player color can be undo by the player when it's his turn. It doesn't change the
                            playing match. I made the web version of <a href="../FrontBlock-Web-Application/">FrontBlock</a>. To note, a left click on the
                            position where to place the pion is required, the key escape close the game, and the space
                            bar key initialize the plate game. To note also, the program is only adapted for a
                            resolution of 1366 per 768 pixels. The program is located under bin/release folder from the
                            code source folder in the dedicated repository. You can check <a
                                href="../directory-showcase/">here</a> to find the right repository with
                            same name.
