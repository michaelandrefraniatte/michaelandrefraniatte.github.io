                        <p>
                            It's easy to use. It's better to use GeForce Experience if you have a Nvidia card for
                            recording desktop. In this case, lower to minimum the audio quality from audio card
                            settings, to not have unsynchronisation of audio and video. The program is located under
                            bin/release folder from the code source folder in the dedicated repository. You can check <a
                                href="../directory-showcase/">here</a> to find the right
                            repository with same name.

                        <h3 class="w3-center colored"><b>Creating Contents on Youtube</b></h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Prefer to record or stream with GeforceExperience and show your contents on Youtube.
                            </li>
                            <li>If you want streaming or recording, it's better to use GeForce Experience if you have a
                                Nvidia card, in this case, lower to minimum the audio quality from audio card settings,
                                to not have unsynchronisation of audio and video, and disable all audio cards useless.
                            </li>
                            <li>GeForce experience with latest driver for Nvidia graphic card is a must have for
                                streaming and recording.</li>
                            <li>If you have a fiber internet conncetion, you can stream with all highest settings
                                (1080p, 60 or 30 fps, 18 Mb/s) on Youtube.</li>
                            <li>If you don't have a good internet connection you can record games and desktop with
                                higher quality and upload on Youtube.</li>
                            <li>You just need a webcam with integrated microphone you connect via USB and start your PC,
                                use predefined shortcuts.</li>
                            <li>Enable desktop capture under confidentiality parameter in order to have some custom
                                overlays.</li>
                            <li>Set your game in windowed borderless mode for better quality of video and audio enabling
                                desktop capture.</li>
                            <li>Set audio quality to 16 bits 44100 Hz under audio settings for your audio cards,
                                lowering audio quality decrease use of bandwidth.</li>
                            <li>The audio level for your audio card recorded ingame shall be set to 100, you just have
                                to adjust your level of earing with your screen or helmet.</li>
                            <li>It's simplest way and more optimized way than using OBS or Twitch Studio, you can find
                                nice overlays to integrate as standalone programs, and it's more important to be
                                concentrate on the content and the gameplay than fight with OBS or Twitch Studio.</li>
                            <li>Prefer to use Geforce Experience for record and stream videos instead of ffmpeg, because
                                with bad settings it destroy a little your PC.</li>
                            <li>Capturing with GeForce Experience for uploading on Youtube need to set parameters.</li>
                            <li>Game with best graphisms and highest resolution of your game screen, while not encounter
                                lags, or better choosing native resolution but upscaling after capture with ffmpeg.</li>
                            <li>720p, 30 FPS, 15 Mbits/s, or 1440p, 30 FPS, 30 MBits/s, or 4k, 30 FPS, 50 Mbits/s, with
                                in game resolution, in video settings of Geforce.</li>
                            <li>Allow capturing desktop if using webcam and if using WebcamOverlay in confidentiality
                                settings of Geforce, but resolution of video will be the resolution of your monitor
                                screen.</li>
                            <li>Disable game capture in Windows settings and restart your computer.</li>
                            <li>To embed a video in Html5 video tag instead of using Youtube iframe, I advice you to
                                rezise video with bitrate using cmd command "ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -b:v 6M output.mp4",
                                because video tag aren't compressing video like Youtube is doing and so low connexion
                                can't watch your video.</li>
                            <li>It's made for avoid loss of video quality while uploading on Youtube, and not having low
                                resolution badly compressed by Youtube, so you can use the cmd command "ffmpeg -i
                                input.mp4 -vf scale=3840:2160:flags=neighbor -b:v 15M output.mp4" for transforming to 4k
                                your video before uploading on Youtube, but you must recalculate the resolution ratio to
                                fit original resolution ratio of your video, with a cruce product.</li>
                            <li>With ffmpeg you can paste several videos one after the others:</li>
                            - Make input.txt containing the following<br />
                            file 'input1.mp4'<br />
                            file 'input2.mp4'<br />
                            file 'input3.mp4'<br />
                            - Concatenate<br />
                            ffmpeg -f concat -i input.txt -c copy output.mp4<br />
                            <li>With ffmpeg you can crop in time a video without the need of an encoder useless for this
                                purpose:</li>
                            ffmpeg -ss 00:01:00 -to 00:02:00 -i input.mp4 -c copy output.mp4<br />
                            <li>With GeForceExperience, you need to allow Windows firewall rules, like with the
                                configuration I made for Steam, but only for traffic in TCP, it don't need any traffic
                                in UDP.</li>
                            <li>To open the GeForceExperience gaming overlay after changing audio settings or connecting
                                a microphone or a camera, you need to restart your computer.</li>
                        </ul>
