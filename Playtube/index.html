                            The program Playtube is a Youtube gallery player where you add videos that can be embed.
                            Make a great list of videos in Playtube for watching it, and share what you add with and in
                            Playtube. Add all videos of a channel in 2 seconds. Or add one by one videos or mix
                            playlists available on Youtube. Enjoy all the power of Youtube. The User Interface (UI) is
                            user friendly for you can change colors as you want. There's nothing better to listen music
                            with video clips of Artists. Let's see...

                        <h3 class="w3-center colored"><b>Considerations About the Program</b></h3>
                        <p>
                            The folder of the program contains a colors text file for customize it. It's possible to
                            remove a video easy, because when clicking on a picture, it copy in clipboard, the video ID
                            from the picture link. Also, it's possible to open a video in the favorite browser or simply
                            copy picture link. It's possible to add without any limit. It need to accept Youtube RGPD
                            once and then restart the program. I made the web version of <a href="../playtube-web-application/">playtube</a>. I also made the Edge extension named
                            playtube-extension. The extension can be installed from <a target="_blank"
                                href="edge://extensions/">edge://extensions/</a>. It's made to use on top of Youtube
                            like the program (i.e. opening the extension when your web browser is on <a
                                target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube</a>). I made a <a
                                href="playtube.txt" download class="dl-link">example</a> file containing my playlists.
                            It need to always open the extension under same site because it use <a href="../localstorage-info">localstorage</a> for saving the gallery. I made the Edge
                            extension named localstorage-info-extension. When letting a few times the cursor on buttons,
                            it show information bubbles, explaining the use of it. This <a href="channel-id.txt"
                                download class="dl-link">file</a> is explaining the way to get playlist ID and channel
                            ID, in order to add videos in a playlist using a Youtube data API key. Also, this <a
                                href="playlist-id.txt" download class="dl-link">file</a> containing the ID for my
                            example of playlists allowing me to update it. My gallery example isn't compatible with the
                            program, but I can convert it. With the extension, it's possible to add several videos in a
                            raw using several ID of videos, channels and playlists in the prompt line by separating with
                            white space. The same for removing video in a playlist with several ID of videos separate
                            with white space. This <a target="_blank" class="dl-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4zvduVAqo">video</a> can help to create Youtube
                            data API key. It's possible to test the process with <a href="../Listing-Videos-Web-Application">Listing Videos</a>. To note, with the Edge
                            extension and program, there's visualization of audio frequencies by enabling Stereo Mixer,
                            with level to 100 and without listening a peripheral, and disabling microphone from audio
                            settings under Windows parameters. It need to allow Youtube access your microphone (audio
                            input with Stereo Mixer) under Edge. To create a new list of playlists, it need simply to
                            open a empty file. It create playlist files to import/export. To note, the key F11, under
                            Edge, is used to have the window page in fullscreen. Also, with the extension, it's possible
                            to control using a microphone (enabling it in Playtube, and instead of Stereo Mixer) with
                            previous, next, all random, random, loop, straight, voice commands the corresponding actions
                            and states. It's possible to ear title of playlist and title of video, each time it load
                            one. There are bugs if using & in playlist names, like not allowing to put it in bold and
                            italic when entering it, so it consist to not use & for playlist names. Also, localstorage
                            can be corrupted after updates of Microsoft or Youtube, making the buttons not appearing,
                            but it's possible to solve the issue by deleting cookies under Edge parameters. By the what,
                            it need to disable security enforcement for Youtube from padlock at left of browsing bar and
                            delete cookies not appearing as Youtube site or Google. It comes with another program, when
                            having a laptop PC and Bluetooth speakers, to enable both. There's a parameters file under same folder of the program to enable it. To note, it ask to set a audio
                            quality of 16 bits and 44100 Hz format for both audio cards, and enable both material
                            acceleration and enhanced audio, under audio settings. It also need to set level of earing for
                            laptop speakers to around 10 for avoid too loud sound. To note, if the program have issue,
                            it need to delete the cache folder under same root. The program is located under bin/release
                            folder from the code source folder in the dedicated repository. You can check <a
                                href="../directory-showcase/">here</a> to find the right
                            repository with same name.
