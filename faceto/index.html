                            With this program you are free to think but you are not ready to face, isn't it? Your home
                            and your schools where you acquire wisdom and knowledge, your friends teaching you what is
                            life, are different than what you find on Youtube, if it's not the music. What about let
                            some comments that will not been removed on videos making you raging because guys behind it
                            on Youtube know nothing about the reality, and they don't want to ear that because they
                            think they are perfect. Let your truth exprims, or simply face to the reality, why not? The
                            program is for linking videos you can watch, and let your comments on it. There a search
                            tool with words on name of channels and on title of videos to find easy all videos already
                            commented on a channel or a subject, by other users and you. It's annonymous but you can
                            view all hilarious comments of a same user on a video. But don't worry if you regret
                            something, you can still remove your own comments easily. It's uncensored, but I don't
                            accept to destroy the program with spaming and phishing, so in this both cases only, I shall
                            remove comments. Let's see...

                        <p>
                            Life isn't people, it's always good to know the truth, self learning have the last word at
                            the end. Discharge your hate in the program, and know yourself. It's made for it. I made the
                            program also as web applications with Firebase, and .NET. It could exist with my own
                            framework named OSEF for Optimized and Simple Enhanced Framework, but apparently it's witout
                            any interest. For be able to open the program it need to create the local authentication
                            file by just opening the program for it under same folder. This for each PC you want to use
                            FaceTo and each time FaceTo change. The program is located under bin/release folder from the
                            code source folder in the dedicated repository. You can check <a
                                href="../directory-showcase/">here</a> to find the right repository with
                            same name.
