                            This program is allowing to have inputs of physical HID (Human Interface Device) and
                            transfer to outputs of virtual HID for competitive gaming. It's easy to use and the program
                            use programmable scripting user interface. It's for competitive gaming, there isn't any
                            cheat like read and write in process memory, so it's not cheating. Let's see...

                        <p>
                            I imagined this standard way, I named SIGIL (StandardInGamingInputLowing), for using gaming
                            controllers in all PC games with highest level of optimization, even with lot of HID
                            handles. You don't need any prerequist, just knowing to read and write some easy
                            programmable scripts. I'm the only one who pushed to highest level the optimization of HID
                            interactions in games with SIGIL. To note, for fully working, like setting options, SIGIL
                            need to run with administrative privilege, and like using launch at PC boot option, you need
                            to copy all external DLL in folder C:/Windows/System32/ with administrative privilege
                            (keyboard.dll, mouse.dll, lhidread.dll, rhidread.dll, prohidread.dll,
                            MotionInputPairing.dll, interception.dll). It need to enable synchronization of Wiimote and
                            Joycons at script run to automatically connect it, closing SIGIL automatically disconnect
                            it, other controllers must be wired. SIGIL is like PGM (ProGamingMapper), but fully working,
                            more optimized, more simple, with more freedom, more HID handles, even data view is handle,
                            and also HID network data passthrough. You can play in any manner you want, it correspond to
                            programmable scripts you write, the way you want. Even if you write scripts to automate some
                            bindings, it's totally not cheating, it's just handles to gaming controllers to play on PC,
                            for competitive gaming. SIGIL is completely different than Cronus Zen and Titan Two, where
                            you use uncompatible controllers on closed platforms, which are consoles, like for using
                            keyboard and mouse to gain an unfair advantage on other players, and where you install
                            gamepacks dedicated for each game, which detect the weapon you use in FPS, like for adapt
                            the right anti-recoil, because it enter in game memory for read and write in order to cheat,
                            like with an aimbot / aim abuse, and so it's not a simple script like everyone are
                            believing, it's humanizing the cheat, but staying overpowered, far from competitive at all.
                            Instead Cronus Zen and Titan Two are for cheaters which need even more than aim-assist. Any
                            noob with any potatoe control can be the strongest with an aimbot / aim abuse, it stay a
                            overpowered cheat, even using it with banana. For example, there are cheaters using Wiimote
                            on consoles, and when we watching their gameplays, it look like it's not them playing, it
                            look so fake, because of their aimbot / aim abuse, otherwise it would not be playable. To
                            opposite, SIGIL don't require any kind of gamepack, like aimbot / aim abuse, to be a
                            competitive gamer. Another good example, is that it's possible to have same button with a
                            little press or a long press for one action or the other, practical when it lack some
                            buttons on the gaming controller you want to play with. From memory, it's only implemented
                            by game developers for their own games, not with a script like I did. I'm also the only one
                            to have found some perfect Wiimote IR cam pointing sensor bar to axis equations. To note,
                            SIGIL is for x player(s) with any combination possible, but above 2 players Wiimote and
                            Joycons need to be connected manually to PC with Bluetooth using the Windows tool add
                            peripherals from control peripherals and printers under control panel, and disconnected
                            manually obviously after closing SIGIL. SIGIL is my final version among all the programs I
                            did on gaming controllers for playing all games with no native supports, and it's better,
                            and very well achieved and complete, better than any other programs and methods you find
                            everywhere. PGM is not maintained at the expense of SIGIL, because SIGIL do everything
                            better and more. SIGIL is 15 years of works finalization. To note, for using several times
                            same controllers, you need each time a new instance with "Scan" function or "Connect"
                            function having the argument number 1 for first controller, 2 for second controller, etc. I
                            added the ability to see polling rate and input delay for each library and for each digital
                            and analogic input and output, for you can test better each library to see what is more
                            competitive, but also for knowledge. I also added a lot of options and accessibility features. 
                            The program is located under bin/release folder from the code source folder in the dedicated 
                            repository. You can check <a href="../directory-showcase/">here</a> to find the right repository with
                            same name.
